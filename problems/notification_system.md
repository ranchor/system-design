## Problem Statement

## Clarification Questions to Interviewer 
* What types of tasks/jobs need to be scheduled?
* What are the expected intervals for scheduling tasks (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours)?
* Do we need to support recurring tasks?
* Should the system support distributed task scheduling?
* What should happen if a task fails or the system crashes during task execution?
* Are there any specific performance or scalability requirements?
* Is there a need for a user interface to manage tasks, or will this be API-driven?
* Should the system provide logging and monitoring for scheduled tasks?

## Requirements
