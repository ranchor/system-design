# SQL Databases and NoSQL Databases
## SQL Databases(Relational Databases)
* Data is organized in tables, where columns represent attributes and rows represent records.
* Relational databases are structured and have predefined schemas
* **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, MS SQL Server, SQLite, and MariaDB.
* **ACID** is a set of properties of relational database transactions.
  * **Atomicity** - Each transaction is all or nothing
  * **Consistency** - Any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another
  * **Isolation** - Executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially
  * **Durability** - Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so
* In comparison with the CAP Theorem, ACID choose consistency over availability.

## No-SQL Databases(Non-relational Databases)
* Manages data in a non-relational structure.
* Schemaless (no fixed schema) and avoids joins
* **BASE** is often used to describe the properties of NoSQL databases. In comparison with the CAP Theorem, BASE chooses 
  availability over consistency.
  * **Basically available - the system guarantees availability.
  * **Soft state** - the state of the system may change over time, even without input.
  * **Eventual consistency** - the system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesn't 
      receive input during that period.
### Common types of NoSQL
#### Key-value stores
>Abstraction: hash table
* Data is stored in an array of key-value pairs
* 'key' is an attribute name which is linked to a 'value'
* Value can be anything from number, string to JSON and BLOB (Binary Large Objects)
* Thus, they are highly scalable and can handle high volumes of traffic
* Ideal for session management e.g. localStorage in the browser, shopping cart.
* Eg: Amazon DynamoDB, Redis, , Aerospike, Memcached, Riak, Couchbase, Oracle Berkeley DB

#### Document databases
>Abstraction: key-value store with documents stored as values
* Data is stored in documents (instead of rows and columns in a table)
* Data stored in JSON
* Documents are grouped together in collections.
* Each document can have an entirely different structure.
* Ideal for storing any type of data, including images, videos and even geospatial data
* Eg: MongoDB, ElasticSearch, CouchDB, CosmosDB, Amazon SimpleDB
![](../resources/basics/db/db_document.png)

#### Wide-column / columnar databases / column-based
>Abstraction: nested map ColumnFamily<RowKey, Columns<ColKey, Value, Timestamp>>
* Column families - containers for rows.
* Keys stored in columns rather than rows
* No need to know all the columns up front.
* Each row can have different number of columns.
* Ideal for Data Warehouses and Business Intelligence (B.I.)
* Eg: Cassandra, Bigtable, Hadoop, HBase, Hypertable, Druid, Azure SQL Data Warehouse

![](../resources/basics/db/db_column1.png)

#### Graph database
* Data is stored in graph structures
  * Nodes: entities
  * Properties: information about the entities
  * Lines: connections between the entities
* Ideal for fraud detection, recommendation engineers, network mapping, social networks etc.
* Eg: Neo4j, Virtuoso, ArangoDB, OrientDB, GraphDB, Amazon Neptune, Fauna, FlockDB

# Pros and Cons of SQL and NoSQL
## Pros of SQL
* **Reduced data storage** - Normalization removed data redundancy and duplication
* **ACID-complian**t - Strong data integrity, security and consistency
* **Normalization** - Database engines are better at optimizing queries to fit on-disk representations
* **Great for complex queries** - SQL is efficient at processing queries and joining data across tables
* **Predefined schema** - Validations are done on the database layer and not the application layer
* Standardized language across different RDBMS
## Cons of SQL
**Vertical scaling** - Relatively more expensive than horizontal scaling
**Rigid data model** - Require up-front design, and harder to make changes (require data migrations and possibly downtime)
**Single point of failure** - Mitigated by replication and failover techniques

## Pros of NoSQL
* **Schemaless** - Easy to make changes to databases as requirements change
* **Flexible data model** - Each entity can have its unique structure
* **Horizontal scaling** - Relatively cheaper and easier, especially for Big Data
* **Highly available** - Designed to support seamless scaling without a significant single point of failure
* **High performance** - Data that is accessed together typically stored together
## Cons of NoSQL
* **Less secure** - Difficult to verify data integrity and consistency (only eventual consistency achieved)
* **Schemaless** - Lacks standardization of data types
* **No normalization** - Database engines are not as good at optimizing queries
* **Larger data storage footprint** - More data duplication due to lack of normalization. But a relatively small drawback as storage is relatively cheap
* **Different types of NoSQL databases** - each have their use cases. E.g. Graph databases are good for analyzing relationships but not range queries

# Which one to use?
## When to use SQL
* **ACID compliance is important**. 
  * Reduce anomalies. 
  * Protect database integrity. 
* **Data is highly structured and does not change frequently**: Predefined schemas allow for easy navigation
* **Working with complex queries** - NoSQL is less robust and has limited query functionality
## Use cases of SQL (with Examples)
* Banking accountâ€™s transaction history
* Text Messaging System
* Ecommerce transactions
* [Stack Overflow scale pretty well with SQL to handle 800M SQL queries daily (8500 RPS at their peak)](https://www.slideshare.net/InfoQ/scaling-stack-overflow-keeping-it-vertical-by-obsessing-over-performance)
* Shopify keep up with the traffic for Black Friday and Cyber Monday at 11 Million QPS using MySQL
* [Uber transitioned from NoSQL to MySQL based storage for their Fulfilment Platform](https://eng.uber.com/fulfillment-platform-rearchitecture/)

## When to use NoSQL
* **Unstructured data** - different data entities can have different structure
* **Faster development speed** - No need to design database schema
* **Priority is easy scalability and availability** - Vertical scaling is expected to be too expensive
* **Priority is not data consistency and integrity** - **NoSQL is not ACID compliant**

## Use cases of NoSQL (with Examples)
* Social media posts donâ€™t have to appear in the same order for every user
* Storing product views of millions of shoppers
* Storing items in usersâ€™ shopping cart
* Fraud detection - Detection algorithm rules require a huge amount of data from various sources
* Personalization and recommendation engine - Huge amount of unstructured data
* Market Basket Analysis e.g. study of purchases done by a customer in a supermarket
* [Worknik migrated from MySQL to MongoDB to handle 10 Million API Requests A Day](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/2/15/wordnik-10-million-api-requests-a-day-on-mongodb-and-scala.html)
* [Netflix built fast, fault-tolerant systems with NoSQL](https://netflixtechblog.com/nosql-at-netflix-e937b660b4c)
* [Gojek migrated from PostgreSQL to Cassandra to handle 100 Million transactions per month](https://www.gojek.io/blog/database-optimisation-on-cassandra)

# Data Replication
# Data Partitioning/Sharding

# Table topology
Table topology refers to the design and arrangement of tables in a database to optimize for various aspects such as performance, scalability, consistency, and availability. Here are some common table topologies used in database design:

## 1. **Single Table Design**
- **Description:** All data related to a particular entity is stored in a single table.
- **Use Case:** Simple applications with low complexity and fewer relationships between entities.
- **Pros:** Easy to implement and manage, simple queries.
- **Cons:** Not scalable for complex applications, can lead to large tables and performance issues.

## 2. **Star Schema**
- **Description:** Central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables.
- **Use Case:** Data warehousing and OLAP systems.
- **Pros:** Simplifies queries and improves performance, easy to understand.
- **Cons:** Redundancy in dimension tables, not ideal for many-to-many relationships.

## 3. **Snowflake Schema**
- **Description:** Extension of star schema where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables.
- **Use Case:** Data warehousing with more complex relationships.
- **Pros:** Reduces redundancy, saves storage space.
- **Cons:** More complex queries, increased number of joins.

## 4. **Normalized Schema**
- **Description:** Data is divided into multiple related tables to eliminate redundancy.
- **Use Case:** OLTP systems where data integrity and efficient updates are crucial.
- **Pros:** Reduces data redundancy, improves data integrity.
- **Cons:** Complex queries due to multiple joins, potential performance issues with read-heavy workloads.

## 5. **Denormalized Schema**
- **Description:** Data is combined into fewer tables to reduce the number of joins.
- **Use Case:** Read-heavy applications where query performance is critical.
- **Pros:** Faster read performance, simpler queries.
- **Cons:** Increases data redundancy, more storage space required, potential data inconsistency.

## 6. **Key-Value Store**
- **Description:** Data is stored as key-value pairs.
- **Use Case:** Simple data retrieval by key, caching, session management.
- **Pros:** Fast retrieval, easy to scale horizontally.
- **Cons:** Limited query capabilities, not suitable for complex queries.

## 7. **Document Store**
- **Description:** Data is stored as documents (e.g., JSON, BSON).
- **Use Case:** Flexible schema requirements, content management systems, logging.
- **Pros:** Flexible schema, easy to handle complex and nested data structures.
- **Cons:** Can lead to data redundancy, complex queries may be less efficient.

## 8. **Column-Family Store**
- **Description:** Data is stored in columns rather than rows.
- **Use Case:** Analytical applications, wide-column data storage.
- **Pros:** Efficient storage and retrieval of sparse data, fast read and write operations.
- **Cons:** Complex schema design, not suitable for highly relational data.

## 9. **Graph Database**
- **Description:** Data is stored in nodes and edges representing entities and their relationships.
- **Use Case:** Applications with complex relationships, social networks, recommendation systems.
- **Pros:** Efficiently handles complex relationships and graph traversal queries.
- **Cons:** Can be complex to design and query, not suitable for simple data models.

## 10. **Time-Series Database**
- **Description:** Data is stored with a focus on time-based entries.
- **Use Case:** Monitoring systems, IoT data, financial tickers.
- **Pros:** Optimized for time-based queries and aggregations, efficient data compression.
- **Cons:** Limited use case, may not be suitable for general-purpose data storage.

## 11. **Hierarchical Database**
- **Description:** Data is organized in a tree-like structure.
- **Use Case:** Applications with a strict parent-child relationship, such as organizational charts.
- **Pros:** Fast navigation and retrieval of hierarchical data.
- **Cons:** Limited flexibility, difficult to manage many-to-many relationships.

## 12. **Distributed Table Topology**
- **Description:** Data is distributed across multiple nodes or regions to achieve high availability and scalability.
- **Use Case:** Large-scale applications requiring high availability, fault tolerance, and low latency.
- **Pros:** Improved scalability and fault tolerance, reduced latency for geographically distributed users.
- **Cons:** Increased complexity in data consistency and coordination, potential for network partitions.

## 13. **Sharded Table Topology**
- **Description:** Data is partitioned across multiple shards or databases based on a sharding key.
- **Use Case:** High-throughput applications, large datasets.
- **Pros:** Horizontal scalability, distributes load evenly across shards.
- **Cons:** Complex shard management, potential hot spots if sharding key is not chosen correctly.
